<i># Validation Framework (Guardrails)<i/>

 ## What is Guardrails? 

Guardrails serve as quality checks to ensure model outputs meet reliability standards in real-world applications, particularly verifying alignment with predefined specifications (like JSON structure).

## Why Guardrails?

Guardrails ensure that Language Model outputs are accurate, compliant with the right format, contain correct information, and are free from harmful content, while also safeguarding against adversarial input to maintain content quality and safety. It makes sure that output just doesn't sound good but is also syntactically as well as factually correct.
